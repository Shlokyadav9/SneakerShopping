Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the development of a website proved to be an exciting and challenging project. Through the utilization of technologies such as Angular JS, Node, Express, MySQL, we were able to create a functional and user-friendly website that allowed customers to place orders and provided an interactive experience. The project provided an opportunity to learn and implement various technologies, including Angular JS for frontend development, Node and Express for backend server-side logic, MySQL for database management, and VS Code as the primary code editor. Working with these technologies allowed us to gain valuable hands-on experience, improve our coding skills, and understand the intricacies of building a web application from scratch. Throughout the project, we encountered and addressed challenges such as integrating frontend and backend components, implementing data validation and security measures, and ensuring smooth communication between different parts of the application. These challenges provided valuable learning opportunities and enhanced our problem-solving skills. In addition to technical skills, the project also helped improve teamwork and collaboration skills as we worked together as a team, assigned tasks, and coordinated efforts to achieve project goals
